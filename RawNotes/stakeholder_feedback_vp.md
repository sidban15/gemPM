Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the walkthrough of the crypto-banking MVP proposal. Overall, I'm impressed with the progress and the focus on security and simplicity. This is a service our clients are asking for, and it's time we had an answer.

My primary feedback is on the proposed fee structure. The deck mentioned a **"$2.00 flat transaction fee"** for all buy or sell orders, regardless of size.

While I appreciate the simplicity, I have two major concerns:

1.  **Does Not Scale for Wealth Clients:** A $2 fee is negligible for a retail customer buying $100 of Bitcoin. However, for a wealth management client executing a $250,000 order, a $2 fee feels arbitrary and frankly, unserious. It completely misprices the service for our most valuable clients. They are used to paying a percentage-based advisory fee, and this model doesn't align.

2.  **Leaves significant revenue on the table:** For larger transactions, we are providing a significant amount of value—liquidity, security, reporting, and institutional trust. A flat $2 fee fails to capture any of this value. A 0.50% fee on that same $250,000 order would be $1,250—a much more appropriate figure that the client would likely not balk at, given the convenience.

**Recommendation:**

We need a tiered or percentage-based fee structure. I propose we consider something like this:

*   **Retail Tier (Transactions under $5,000):** A simple, transparent flat fee (e.g., $2 or $3) is likely fine here. The goal is accessibility.
*   **Wealth Tier (Transactions over $5,000):** A percentage-based fee, perhaps on a sliding scale. For example:
    *   0.75% for trades between $5,000 and $100,000.
    *   0.50% for trades over $100,000.

This model allows us to serve the retail market effectively while properly pricing the service for the clients who will drive the most volume and revenue. It aligns with their expectations and our value proposition.

Happy to discuss this further. Let's build this right.

Best,

Michael Evans
