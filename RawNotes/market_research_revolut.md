**Focus:** Commission and Fee Structure for Crypto Trading.

---

**Overview:**

Revolut has successfully integrated crypto trading into its app, making it a key benchmark for our project. Their model is built on simplicity and accessibility, but their revenue is generated through a spread-based commission structure that is not always transparent to the end-user.

**Commission Structure:**

Revolut's fee structure is tiered based on the user's subscription plan:

*   **Standard (Free) Users:**
    *   **Commission:** ~1.99% (with a minimum fee, e.g., €0.99).
    *   **Mechanism:** Revolut builds the fee into the exchange rate they show the user. It's not explicitly broken out as a separate "fee" on the confirmation screen. They are taking a "spread." For example, if the market rate for BTC is $50,000, they might sell it to the user at $50,995 (a ~1.99% markup).

*   **Premium & Metal (Paid) Users:**
    *   **Commission:** ~1.49% for Premium, ~0.99% for Metal.
    *   **Incentive:** The reduced commission is a key selling point for their paid subscription tiers, encouraging users to upgrade for lower trading costs.

**Key Strategic Insights:**

1.  **The "Spread" Model:** Revolut avoids the negative psychological impact of a "fee" by embedding their commission into the quoted price. Users see a final price and simply accept or decline. This reduces friction, though it lacks transparency.
2.  **Tiered Structure Drives Upgrades:** By offering lower fees to paid subscribers, they create a powerful incentive for active traders to upgrade their accounts, generating a stable, recurring revenue stream for Revolut.
3.  **Simplicity Over All:** The entire process is designed to be incredibly simple: Tap "Buy," enter amount, see the final price, and confirm. This appeals to the mass-market user who is intimidated by traditional exchanges.

**Competitive Weakness / Our Opportunity:**

*   **Lack of Transparency:** Sophisticated users are aware of the hidden spread and often complain about the true cost of trading on Revolut. We can differentiate by offering a more transparent model (e.g., a small, flat fee + the real market rate).
*   **Limited Advanced Features:** Revolut is for basic buying and selling. It does not offer advanced order types, staking (on most assets), or DeFi integrations. This is a segment we could potentially capture.

**Conclusion:**

Revolut's model is a masterclass in monetizing retail crypto enthusiasm through simplicity. We should consider a similar spread-based model for its low friction, but weigh it against our brand's commitment to transparency. A hybrid model (e.g., a small, clearly stated commission) could be a winning strategy.
