**Interview with "Gen Z" Investor (Leo)**

**Date:** 2026-02-15

**Interviewer:** Product Team

**Client Profile:** 22-year-old, recent college graduate, works in tech. Uses our bank for checking/direct deposit. Active user of Robinhood and Coinbase.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Mental Model: "Banking App vs. Investing Apps"**
    *   He views our banking app as "where my money lives" - it's for paying rent, getting paid, and saving for short-term goals. It's "safe" and "boring."
    *   He views Coinbase/Robinhood as "where my money grows" - it's for taking risks, investing, and engaging with the market. It's "fast" and "exciting."
    *   He currently has to ACH transfer money from our bank to Coinbase, wait 2-3 days for it to settle, and *then* he can buy crypto. This delay is a major source of frustration.

*   **The "One-Tap" Dream:**
    *   His ideal experience is to eliminate the friction between his cash and his investments.
    *   **Quote:** "Why can't I just see the price of Bitcoin inside my banking app, tap 'Buy', enter '$100', and have it instantly? The money is right there in my checking account. The delay feels so old-fashioned."
    *   He wants the process to be as easy as buying a coffee with Apple Pay. He used the word "instant" at least ten times.

*   **User Experience Expectations:**
    *   **Simplicity is paramount.** He is not a professional trader. He doesn't want to see complex order books or charts. He wants a simple line graph of the price, a "Buy" button, and a "Sell" button.
    *   **Trust:** He expressed that he's "a little nervous" keeping large sums of money on exchanges, having heard stories of hacks and collapses. He said he would feel "much safer" if his crypto was held by the same institution that holds his paycheck. He trusts our bank's brand.
    *   **Fees:** He is very sensitive to fees. He knows Robinhood has "free" trades (though he understands they make money on the spread). He would be willing to pay a small, transparent fee for the convenience and security of buying through our app. He suggested "like, a dollar or something" would feel fair.

**Conclusion:**

This interview highlights the massive opportunity with the younger demographic. They are crypto-native but desire the security and convenience of an integrated financial experience. The primary user need is to **bridge the gap between their static cash account and the dynamic investment world**, removing the friction of multi-day settlement periods. The winning product will combine the instant, simple user experience of an app like Robinhood with the trust and security of our established banking institution.
