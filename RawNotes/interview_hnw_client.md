**Interview with HNW Client (Johnathan Miller)**

**Date:** 2026-02-15

**Interviewer:** Sarah Chen, Head of Product

**Client Profile:** High-Net-Worth Individual, ~15 years with the bank, significant equity and real estate holdings. Has been actively investing in crypto since 2020.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Primary Goal:** Wants to unlock liquidity from his crypto portfolio without selling the underlying assets. He is bullish long-term and wants to avoid capital gains tax events.
*   **Collateral Preference:** Primarily interested in using Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral. He holds other altcoins but considers them too volatile for this purpose.
*   **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:** Expects a competitive LTV, citing figures from crypto-native lenders (e.g., 40-50%). He's willing to accept a slightly lower LTV (e.g., 35-40%) for the convenience and trust of working with our bank.
*   **Pain Points with Existing Solutions:** Finds current crypto lenders to be opaque, with complex fee structures and concerns about the security of his assets. He mentioned the "CeFi blowups" of 2022 as a major source of anxiety.
*   **"Why Us?":** He trusts our bank's security, regulatory standing, and longevity. He said, "I know my money isn't going to disappear overnight. I want that same peace of mind for my crypto."
*   **Desired Features:**
    *   A simple, clear dashboard showing his collateral value, LTV ratio, and margin call thresholds in real-time.
    *   Automated alerts via SMS and email if his LTV approaches a critical level.
    *   The ability to easily add more collateral or pay down the loan from his existing checking account.
*   **Quote:** "If you can let me tap into my ETH portfolio to fund a real estate down payment, without the headache of selling and wiring funds from three different apps, you've got a customer for life."
